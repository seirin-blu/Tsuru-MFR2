# Tsuru MFR2
A tray mount 3D printable mfr2-styled case for the [Tsuru Keyboard PCB](https://github.com/kilipan/tsuru)

Designed to be used with heat inserts such as [these m2 x 4mm x 3.5mm OD heat inserts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MCWWL9L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You may want to opt for m2x6mm rather than m2x4mm machine screws so you can double up the washers and have it still securly screw into the heat inserts.

This has been tested with FDM printing only. If you want to print in SLA, edit the holes so that they are around 1.8mm ID.
